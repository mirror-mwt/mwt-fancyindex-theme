### GitHub Desktop

There is an [unofficial Linux version](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop) of the [official GitHub Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). This is the primary official mirror for the project. You can find [installation instructions on my website](https://mattwthomas.com/mirrors/#github-desktop) as well as in the [README of the project](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/blob/linux/README.md).
