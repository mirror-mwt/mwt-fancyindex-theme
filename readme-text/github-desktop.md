### GitHub Desktop

There is an [unofficial Linux version](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop) of the [official GitHub Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). This is the primary official mirror for the project. The following install script should work for most systems:

~~~sh
wget -qO- "https://mirror.mwt.me/github-desktop/install.sh" | sudo sh
~~~

Manual installation instructions are available [on the mirrors page](https://matthewthom.as/mirrors/#github-desktop) as well as in the [README of the project](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/blob/linux/README.md).
