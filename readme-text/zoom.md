### Zoom

Zoom does not provide official repositories. These repositories serve the latest official `.deb` and `.rpm` from Zoom. You can install the repo by running the following commands:

~~~sh
wget -qO- "https://mirror.mwt.me/zoom/install.sh" | sudo -s
~~~

More complete installation instructions are available on [the mirrors page](https://www.matthewthom.as/mirrors/#zoom) and in the [README for the project](https://github.com/mwt/zoom-apt-repo/).
