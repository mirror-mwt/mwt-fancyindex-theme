### Zotero

I have an official mirror of the Debian/Ubuntu repository for the [Zotero citation manager](https://www.zotero.org) as well as [Juris-M](https://juris-m.github.io/). You can add the repo by running the following script:

~~~sh
wget -qO- "https://mirror.mwt.me/zotero/install.sh" | sudo -s
~~~

Manual installation instructions are available on [the mirrors page](https://www.matthewthom.as/mirrors/#zotero).
