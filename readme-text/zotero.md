### Zotero

I have an official mirror of the Debian/Ubuntu repository for the [Zotero citation manager](https://www.zotero.org) as well as [Juris-M](https://juris-m.github.io/). You can add the repo by running the following script:

~~~sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retorquere/zotero-deb/master/install.sh | sudo bash /dev/stdin "https://mirror.mwt.me/zotero/deb"
~~~

More complete installation instructions are available on [the mirrors page](https://mattwthomas.com/mirrors/#zotero).
